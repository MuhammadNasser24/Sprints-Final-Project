# Automated DevOps Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on automating the deployment of a Flask web application and MySQL database using Docker containers. The deployment process is streamlined by leveraging a combination of Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Ansible for server configuration, and Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), all orchestrated by Kubernetes for container management.

## Tools at Your Disposal

## Project Organization

The project is divided into distinct phases, each catering to a specific facet of the infrastructure:

- **Containerization**: Crafting Dockerfiles for the Flask app and MySQL database, complemented by a Docker Compose file for local trial.
- **Terraform Enactment**: Defining integral infrastructure elements like VPC, subnets, EC2 instance, ECR repository, EKS cluster, and more.
- **Ansible Automation**: Facilitating the configuration of the EC2 instance by installing Jenkins, AWS CLI, kubectl, and Docker.
- **Kubernetes Proficiency**: Developing Kubernetes manifests to deploy the Flask app and MySQL database on the EKS cluster.
- **Jenkins Pipeline Mastery**: Setting up a Jenkins pipeline to automate build, push, and deployment activities.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Getting Hold of the Flask App and MySQL Database

Clone the Flask app and MySQL database repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uym2/MySQL-and-Python.git
```

### 2. Containerizing the App and Database

Navigate to the Docker directory:
```bash
cd Docker
```

Build Docker images and run containers:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 3. Constructing AWS Infrastructure with Terraform

Navigate to the Terraform directory:
```bash
cd Terraform
```

Initialize Terraform:
```bash
terraform init
```

Apply Terraform configurations:
```bash
terraform apply
```

### 4. Configuring EC2 Instance via Ansible

Navigate to the Ansible directory:
```bash
cd Ansible
```

Run Ansible playbook for EC2 configuration:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt playbook.yml -e @variables.yml
```

### 5. Constructing Kubernetes Manifests

Apply Kubernetes manifests:
```bash
kubectl apply -f Kubernetes
```

### 6. Orchestrating Jenkins Pipeline

Navigate to the Jenkins directory:
```bash
cd Jenkins
```

Follow the guide to set up the Jenkins pipeline.
